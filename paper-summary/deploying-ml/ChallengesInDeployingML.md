### Abstract
- ML models in the real world can present a number of issues and concerns with regards to deployment
- This paper lays out a research agenda to explore approaching addressing these challenges

### Introduction
- This report consists of 1) overview of ML deployment workflow 2) review use case studies to extract problems and concerns at each deployment stage 3) deployment workflow from ethical consideration and end users trust 

### ML Deployment WOrkflow
1. **Data Management**: prepare data that is needed to build a ML model
2. **Model Learning**: model selection and training
3. **Model verification**: ensure model adheres to performance requirements
4. **Model Deployment**: integration of trained model into the software infrastructure

### Data Management 
- A) Data collection: Software engineers like single responsibility structure, however the flip side is that that at large scale it is impossible to keep track of this data
- B) Data preprocessing:
